// Add column
Add a new column to existing table in a migration

    php artisan make:migration add_customer_rate_to_shipment_carrier_quotations_table --table="shipment_carrier_quotations"

    php artisan migrate

// Rename column
How can I rename column in laravel using migration?

	php artisan make:migration rename_shipment_address_column --table="shipment_address"

	Now I want to rename from_time to pickup_from_time.
	$table->renameColumn('from_time','pickup_from_time'); // up function

	$table->renameColumn('pickup_from_time','from_time'); // down function

// Drop column
Drop column from table 
	php artisan make:migration drop_column2_to_shipment_address_table --table="shipment_address"   
        $table->dropColumn('address_type');

// correct way to create model and migration file
	 php artisan make:model ModelName -m



NOTE :- If you did mistake in migration process you can delete migration files, model files. And also clear data from migration table
	(Only which file you created) and drop the table from database.
